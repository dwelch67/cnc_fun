Like the others in the bigbasic, this is a program that generates
n "points" on a side, in this case arcs...same as bigbasic but arcs
instead of corners.

I learned on twoby that the corners in this case, look at arcfive.png,
are not lined up, the radius is different so it wrong IMO.  I fixed
it on twoby but not here.  With that math could fix this one.  The
corners need to be bumped out a bit at a 45 degree angle until the 
tangents of the arcs and the half circle in the corner line up (use
gimp and draw a line along the arcs and see that the corner half circles
are not lined up at this time).

I did this to do this, I prefer the corners not this arc, but was
just starting this celtic art activity, this repo and cnc cuts with
these and this lead to threet for example.  Hmm the corners on that one
should be wrong as well...hmmm.
