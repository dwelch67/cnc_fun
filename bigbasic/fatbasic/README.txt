So I made life a little simpler, just making horizontal and vertical 
bars and then in inkscape using shift you can switch to a node view then
using shift can select two or three paths at a time on the corners and
then path->union will make them one then use that to set up the cnc.

Like bigbasic and other subdirectories, you can run the program to
generate 3 or more points on a side, 3,4,5, 100, 1000...
